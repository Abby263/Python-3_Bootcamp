# Python-3 programming tutorial

This is a concise Python 3 programming tutorial for people who think
that reading is boring. I try to show everything with simple code
examples; there are no long and complicated explanations with fancy
words. If you have never programmed before click
[here](basics/what-is-programming.md) to find out what programming is
like and get started.

This tutorial is aimed at people with no programming experience at all
or very little programming experience. If you have programmed a lot in
the past using some other language you may want to read [the official
tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) instead.

You can use Python 3.3 or any newer Python with this tutorial. **Don't
use Python 2.** If you write a Python 2 program now someone will need to
convert it to Python 3 later, so it's best to just write Python 3 to
begin with. Python 3 code will work just fine in Python 4, so you don't
need to worry about that. Python 2 also has horrible
[Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html) problems,
so it's difficult to write Python 2 code that works correctly with
non-English characters (like π and ♫).
